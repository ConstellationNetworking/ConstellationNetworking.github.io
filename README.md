- **Teachers** 🏫: Acknowledge the need for motivation in networking opportunities.
- **Students** 🎓: Recognize networking opportunities but lack motivation and fail to see immediate benefits.

## Solution 💡

Constellation is more than just an edtech platform; it's a community where students can learn by doing. They can connect with peers, share knowledge, and explore new learning areas, all within a secure, student-focused environment.
